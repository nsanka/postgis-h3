# The workflow is triggered on `push` events to the `main` branch, and when changes are made to the `Dockerfile` or any file in the `.devcontainer` directory.
# It is also triggered on `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch, and when changes are made to the `Dockerfile` or any file in the `.devcontainer` directory.
